# FieldSync: Enterprise Field Service Management Platform

**Full-Stack Development | Real-Time Architecture | Multi-Tenant SaaS | B2B Platform | Mobile-First**

**FieldSync** is a production-grade field service management platform built from scratch to solve real operational challenges. This enterprise SaaS solution handles the complete lifecycle of field operations‚Äîfrom automated ticket creation through email parsing, real-time engineer tracking with background GPS, instant multi-party communication, to secure payment processing across Stripe and Razorpay.

The system manages multiple client companies with strict role-based access control, processes 100+ tickets simultaneously, tracks field engineers in real-time, and maintains bank-grade security with multi-layer protection.

## üéØ The Problem

Field service companies struggle with:
- **Manual ticket creation**: 5-10 minutes per ticket, prone to errors
- **Zero visibility**: No idea where engineers are or job status
- **Communication chaos**: Phone calls, SMS, and WhatsApp scattered everywhere
- **Multi-company complexity**: No unified system for managing multiple clients
- **Payment tracking**: Manual invoicing and payment reconciliation

---

## üíé Core Features

### Multi-Tenant Data Architecture

**Complex Mongoose schemas with company-scoped queries ensuring complete data isolation between tenants.**

- **Ticket Model**: Interaction logging for audit trails, multi-stage assignment workflow (pending ‚Üí accepted ‚Üí rejected), dynamic visibility rules (Draft, Direct Engineer, Service Provider, All Engineers)
- **Role-Based Access Control**: 5 role types (Admin, NetCovet Manager, Company Admin, Supervisor, Engineer) with middleware-enforced permissions
- **Company Scoping**: All database queries filtered by companyId to prevent cross-tenant data leaks

```javascript
// Complete audit trail for every ticket action
interactions: [{
  event: String,      // "Created", "Assigned", "Status Changed"
  actor: String,      // User who performed the action
  timestamp: Date
}]
```

**Security Implementation**:
- Helmet.js with CSP policies + HSTS headers
- Rate limiting (progressive slow-down + hard limits)
- HMAC signature validation on critical endpoints
- MongoDB injection & XSS sanitization on all inputs
- JWT with refresh tokens + blacklist for instant revocation
- Bcrypt password hashing (12 rounds)

---

### Automated Email-to-Ticket System

**Zero manual data entry. Emails sent to dedicated inbox are automatically parsed and converted to tickets.**

- **Mailslurp + IMAP**: Monitors dedicated inbox in real-time
- **Smart Parsing**: Extracts sender, subject, body, attachments using `mailparser`
- **Auto-Assignment**: Matches sender email to company and assigns ticket
- **Error Handling**: Retry logic with admin notifications on failures

```javascript
const processEmails = async () => {
  const messages = await connection.search(['UNSEEN']);
  for (const email of messages) {
    const parsed = await parseEmail(email);
    await createTicket({
      senderEmail: parsed.from,
      subject: parsed.subject,
      description: parsed.body
    });
  }
};
```

**Result**: Ticket creation time reduced from 5-10 minutes to **instant**.

---

### Real-Time Location Tracking

**Background GPS tracking continues even when app is closed or backgrounded.**

- **Expo Location + Task Manager**: Native background location services
- **Smart Updates**: Triggers on 10m distance change OR every 5 seconds
- **Battery Optimized**: Configurable accuracy levels
- **Android Foreground Service**: Persistent notification for compliance

```javascript
await Location.startLocationUpdatesAsync(LOCATION_TASK_NAME, {
  accuracy: Location.Accuracy.High,
  distanceInterval: 10,
  timeInterval: 5000,
  foregroundService: {
    notificationTitle: 'Location Tracking Active'
  }
});
```

**Admin Dashboard**: Live Google Maps showing all active engineers, location history, proximity alerts for job sites.

---

### Real-Time Chat System

**Socket.IO-powered messaging with file sharing, typing indicators, and read receipts.**

- **Room Architecture**: Ticket-based chat rooms + direct messaging
- **Rich Media**: Images, PDFs, documents stored on AWS S3
- **GraphQL Integration**: Message history with efficient pagination
- **Authenticated Sockets**: JWT verification on socket connection

```javascript
io.use(async (socket, next) => {
  const token = extractToken(socket);
  const user = await authenticateToken(token);
  socket.user = user;
  next();
});
```

**Features**: File uploads up to 50MB, message delivery status, typing indicators, conversation history across web and mobile.

---

### Intelligent Ticket Workflow

**Automated status transitions with configurable visibility and pricing rules.**

**Lifecycle**: Draft ‚Üí Open ‚Üí In Progress ‚Üí On-Hold (with reason) ‚Üí Closed (with remarks)

**Assignment Flow**: 
- Admin assigns ‚Üí Engineer receives notification ‚Üí Engineer accepts/rejects ‚Üí Ticket tracks acceptance count vs required engineers

**Visibility Controls**:
- **Draft**: Only visible to admins
- **Direct Engineer**: Assigned engineer only
- **Service Provider**: All service provider engineers
- **Visible to All**: All available engineers

**Bulk Operations**: Import 100+ tickets from Excel, bulk status updates, automated email notifications.

---

### Analytics Dashboard

**Real-time KPIs with WebSocket updates and Framer Motion animations.**

- **Ticket Metrics**: Open, In-Progress, Closed, On-Hold counts with trend analysis
- **Financial Data**: Total revenue, pending payments, average ticket value
- **Performance**: Average resolution time, engineer acceptance rates
- **Export**: Filterable reports to Excel with ExcelJS

---

### Dual Payment Gateway Integration

**Global payment support with Stripe (international) and Razorpay (India/UPI).**

**Stripe**: Payment intents, webhook handling, automatic reconciliation, refunds
**Razorpay**: UPI payments, order verification, payment links, engineer payouts

**Features**: Automated invoicing on ticket closure, payment status tracking, manual UPI override for offline transactions.
